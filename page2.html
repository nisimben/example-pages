      Scroll the page to observe how the fixed navigation and footer stay anchored to the viewport.
      Pay attention to the sticky note: it starts like a normal element and then "sticks" to the top
      of the viewport when you scroll past it. Try adjusting the <code>top</code> value in the CSS.

      <h2>Scrollable Content</h2>
      <p>
        This page lets you practice <strong>fixed</strong> and <strong>sticky</strong> positioning. The navigation bar
        at the top uses <code>position: fixed</code> and stays at the top as you scroll. The footer uses the same
        technique to remain at the bottom of the viewport.
      </p>
      <p>
        The side note uses <code>position: sticky</code>. At first, it behaves like a normal block element,
        participating in the flow. When you scroll past it, it becomes fixed relative to the viewport and stays
        visible until you scroll past the end of its container.
      </p>
      <p>
        Experiment by adjusting the <code>top</code> property of the sticky note. This property determines the point
        at which the note sticks. Try values like <code>0</code>, <code>50px</code>, or <code>100px</code> to see how
        it changes the sticking behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that the main content area has extra padding on the top and bottom. This ensures that the content
        doesn’t get hidden behind the fixed header and footer. Without this padding, part of your content would be
        obscured when the page loads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add more paragraphs or even images to make the page longer. The more content you have, the easier it is to
        see how the fixed and sticky elements behave while scrolling.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you’re comfortable with fixed and sticky elements, move on to Page 3 where you’ll explore layering and
        <code>z-index</code> by creating overlapping elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep practicing and experimenting. Understanding positioning will help you build more complex layouts without
        relying on advanced layout systems like Flexbox or CSS Grid.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also try making your own sticky elements within this page. For example, try adding another sidebar
        that sticks after a different scroll threshold, or create a sticky header inside the article.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember: <strong>fixed</strong> elements are removed from the normal document flow and stay glued to the
        viewport. <strong>Sticky</strong> elements start as normal, then switch to fixed positioning after you scroll
        past them.
